# Project Assessment

## Self assessment

My main contribution to the project was creating the Tableau visualizations.  At first, it felt like I wasn't pulling my weight as I had to wait for some of the database cleanup and merging before being able to create some of the tables and maps.  I definitely needed to wait until the very end to add the prediction part of the project when deciding who the winner would be after choosing two different teams until the model was completely done.

I also found that some of our data didn't cleanly tie the school name/ID with what city they were in to create the conference map.  This took a lot of work to get the map to work.  I also found that some of the formatting of the fields needed to be changed in order for the visualization to accurately show and reflect what we wanted it to show.  

During group time, I was able to provide suggestions for when something wasn't working as anticipated.  This reassured me that I did pick up some things along the way.

When it was first decided that I would work on the visualizations, I assumed that the files we originally decided to use would give me all the information that I needed to create some amazing maps.  I quickly realized they didn't and I needed to create my own DataFrames to work with to try and merge some data points.  My first attempt at making a conference map was to color each state with the conference they were in.  After looking at Wisconsin and noticing that it wasn't the same color as Minnesota, I knew that something was wrong.  It was assigning a color to match the conference of the ID that was lowest.  I knew that both University of Minnesota and University of Wisconsin-Madison were in the Big 10 Conference, so I went back to the drawing board and had to add the city of the school and then make the map colored dots to plot the city and the same color was the same conference.
