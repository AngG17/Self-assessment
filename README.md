# March Madness Project Assessment

## Self Assessment

My main contribution to the project was creating the Tableau visualizations.  At first, it felt like I wasn't pulling my weight as I had to wait for some of the database cleanup and merging before being able to create some of the tables and maps.  I definitely needed to wait until the very end to add the prediction part of the project when deciding who the winner would be after choosing two different teams until the model was completely done.

I also found that some of our data didn't cleanly tie the school name/ID with what city they were in to create the conference map.  This took a lot of work to get the map to work.  I also found that some of the formatting of the fields needed to be changed in order for the visualization to accurately show and reflect what we wanted it to show.  

During group time, I was able to provide suggestions for when something wasn't working as anticipated.  This reassured me that I did pick up some things along the way.

When it was first decided that I would work on the visualizations, I assumed that the files we originally decided to use would give me all the information that I needed to create some amazing maps.  I quickly realized they didn't and I needed to create my own DataFrames to work with to try and merge some data points.  My first attempt at making a conference map was to color each state with the conference they were in.  After looking at Wisconsin and noticing that it wasn't the same color as Minnesota, I knew that something was wrong.  It was assigning a color to match the conference of the ID that was lowest.  I knew that both University of Minnesota and University of Wisconsin-Madison were in the Big 10 Conference, so I went back to the drawing board and had to add the city of the school and then make the map colored dots to plot the city and the same color was the same conference.

## Team Assessment

Our team worked really well together.  At the beginning we asked everyone what their strength was and we assigned parts of the project to correspond with those strengths.  I think this helped everyone feel that they could be successful and an equal contributor.  

We used a group slack message to communicate any questions or problems that came up.  We also used class time to share screens and work through any code issues that came up.  We were able to help each other out by offering suggestions.  We worked through the entire class time and sometimes over and made sure before logging off for the night that everyone knew what their assignment was that needed to be completed before the next time we met.  

We shared cleaned files on GitHub so that others could use the file instead of creating their own for specific parts of the project.  I used cleaned files to create some of the visualization.  Other files were used to create some of the trivia questions.

I don't think I would have changed anything with how we communicated.  We were active in our chats and always offering suggestions or advice.  

Our strength was that we got along well and most of us had been communicating since the beginning with offering help when questions were asked.

The one piece of advice I would have for groups is to have one person keep you on track.  Hannah did a great job of making sure that every box was checked and that we had each piece of the rubric covered.
